The given code represents an interactive Emoji Application project using ReactJS. The app allows users to use a wide range of emojis for communication and expression. The developed application provides a friendly user interface where users can easily browse through a collection of emojis which are provided by the module “emoji-picker-react“. The main functionalities of the developed application consist of a feature that allows users to explore specific emojis by selecting the emoji. As users select the emoji, the application copies that emoji to the clipboard so users can paste it into the chat window. We have also used “react-toastify” package to show a stylish toast message to user stating that the emoji is been copied to the clipboard. This allows users to easily select the emoji and use them for their communication.
